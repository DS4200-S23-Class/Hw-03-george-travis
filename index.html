                <h3>Marks:</h3>
                    <ul><li>States use areas</li>
                        <li>Bar chart uses lines</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Channels:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Horizontal and vertical position:
                                <ul><li>Represents attribute of categorical type (states).</li>
                                    <li>The horizontal and vertical position of states helps users identify them if users are familiar with the map of the USA. The map of the USA is a better mapping than others as it is commonly used. The issue with this mapping, however, lies in the fact that it does not state relevant information about states.
                                    </li>
                                </ul></li>
                            <li>Color (hue):
                                <ul><li>Represents attribute of categorical type (Democrat vs. Republican).</li>
                                    <li>This is a good mapping as the colors share the same luminance and saturation, but their hues are much different. The stark contrast of these hues allows users to easily identify which party won which state. Also, these are the most commonly associated colors with the two political parties being compared.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Shape:
                                <ul><li>Represents attribute of categorical type (states).</li>
                                    <li>Similar to the position channel, this channel is used to show the shape of states and the USA. This is a good mapping as it is often used in these scenarios and users should know what it means. It has the drawback that it does not provide enough context about the state populations.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Area:
                                <ul><li>Represents attribute of quantitative type (Electoral College votes).</li>
                                    <li>This is a good mapping as the area covered by the bar chart is proportional to the number of Electoral College votes garnered by each side.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>Colormap(s):</h3>
                    <ul><li>Categorical colormap (blue vs. red)
                            <ul><li>Represents attributes of categorical type.</li>
                                <li>This is a good mapping because the colors are perceptually distant and have roughly the same saturation and value. The saturation does not confuse users.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Marks:</h3>
                    <ul><li>Batted balls are displayed as points</li>
                        <li>Different types of hits (pop-ups, fly balls, line drives, ground balls) are designated via lines.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Channels:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Horizontal and vertical position:
                                <ul><li>Represents attribute of quantitative type.</li>
                                    <li>The x-axis shows the exit velocity (in mph) of batted balls, and the y-axis shows the launch angle (in degrees) of batted balls. This is a good mapping as it allows users to compare the speed of a ball with its launch angle, and what that means for the resulting hit.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Color (luminance)
                                <ul><li>Represents attribute of quantitative type (LWTS).</li>
                                    <li>This is a good mapping because it gives differentiability to the chart. The luminance of the data points allows users to understand which points have the strongest (or weakest) value. This mapping struggles as the background is light and that is also how average value points show up. It can be difficult to see these points and understand their meaning.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Vertical position:
                                <ul><li>Represents attribute of categorical type (type of batted ball).</li>
                                    <li>This is a good mapping as it provides separability to the visualization. It gives users an easy way to understand exactly how different batted balls have performed.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>Colormap(s):</h3>
                    <ul><li>Divergent colormap
                            <ul><li>Represents attributes of quantitative type.</li>
                                <li>This is a good mapping because it shows the full range of the LWTS on different batted balls. The colors at either end of the spectrum are perceptually different enough for users to be able to tell at a glance what is "good" and what is "bad". The only issue is that the average value is depicted as white and it seems to blend in to the background a bit.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
